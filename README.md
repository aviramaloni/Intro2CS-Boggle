## About
### Project's Essence
In our interpretation of the 'Boggle' game, we decided to concentrate 
on delivering the best user experience. We truly believe that a good
game, is a game which involves all senses.

### Features
We can honestly say, that
playing the game, makes an exiting and irresistible experience, all thanks
to some special features we decided to add:
- The game appearance is custom made, featuring colourful and intriguing
  designs. Buttons and backgrounds were designed to match the theme of the
  game, using pre-made pictures for their display. Some buttons visually 
  feedback the user's actions in the game, giving a live and satisfying
  reaction.
- The game also incorporates sound gestures, using the 'pygame' module, to
  even further enhance the user's multi-sensory experience. Each sound
  gesture was carefully chosen to match specific actions.
- The game has an addictive sound track playing in the background, making
  a true sensation of adventure.
